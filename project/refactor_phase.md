  - [ ] arbitrage-calculation.service.ts → Pure math & profit calculations
  - [ ] market-analysis.service.ts → Price analysis & market data
  - [ ] tax-calculation.service.ts → All tax & fee calculations
  - [ ] logistics.service.ts → Cargo, transport, route optimization
  - [ ] arbitrage-orchestrator.service.ts → Main service that coordinates others

### 🎯 **2.2 ESI Service Optimization**

## 🚀 **PHASE 3: PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT** (Priority 1 - After Phase 1)

### 🌐 **3.1 Production Environment Setup**

- [ ] **Database Setup**
  - [ ] Set up production PostgreSQL database
  - [ ] Run all migrations on production DB
  - [ ] Configure connection pooling
  - [ ] Set up database backups

### 📦 **3.2 Application Deployment**

---

## 📋 **CURRENT ASSESSMENT**

### ✅ **What's Working Well (Keep As-Is)**

- **Prisma Schema**: Excellent design, proper relationships, good indexing
- **Database Structure**: Well-normalized, efficient queries
- **Core Business Logic**: Arbitrage calculations are profitable
- **Data Pipeline**: Adam4EVE integration works reliably
- **TypeScript Setup**: Good type safety throughout

### 🔧 **What Needs Refactoring**

- **Large Services**: 971-line ArbitrageService needs splitting
- **Logging System**: Overly complex file logging
- **Module Organization**: Multiple controllers for same concerns
- **Code Duplication**: Similar logic in multiple places
- **Missing Documentation**: No Swagger/API docs

### 🚀 **Production Blockers**

1. **No Production Deployment** → Daily data not being collected
2. **Complex Logging** → Hard to monitor in production
3. **Large Services** → Hard to debug and maintain
4. **Missing API Docs** → Hard to use and integrate

---

## 🎯 **SUCCESS CRITERIA**

### **Phase 1 Complete When:**

- [ ] Swagger documentation accessible at `/api`
- [ ] Simple console logging (no file logging)
- [ ] Market-data module has 4 focused services instead of current mess
- [ ] All dead code removed
- [ ] Production deployment successful
- [ ] Daily data pipeline running in production

### **Phase 2 Complete When:**

- [ ] ArbitrageService split into 5 focused services (< 200 lines each)
- [ ] ESI service simplified and optimized
- [ ] All interfaces consolidated and organized

### **Long-term Success:**

- [ ] Easy to add new features
- [ ] Clear separation of concerns
- [ ] Comprehensive API documentation
- [ ] Production monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Reliable daily data collection

## 📅 **TIMELINE ESTIMATE**

- **Phase 1**: 2-3 days (Fundamentals & Cleanup)
- **Phase 3**: 1 day (Production Deployment)
- **Phase 2**: 3-4 days (Arbitrage Refactor)

**Total**: ~1 week for production-ready, maintainable system
