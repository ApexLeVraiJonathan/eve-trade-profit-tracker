    }
  ]
}
```

### 3. In-Game Multi-Buy Process

#### Step 1: Copy the Multi-Buy Format

From the API response, copy the `multiBuyFormat` text:

```
Breacher Pod Rapid Firing	3
Small Vorton Specialization	16
Sensor Booster II	1
Omnidirectional Tracking Enhancer II	3
Drone Link Augmentor II	4
Curator I	10
Hammerhead II	5
Bouncer I	10
```

#### Step 2: In EVE Online

1. **Go to Jita** (Jita IV - Moon 4 - Caldari Navy Assembly Plant)
2. **Open Market Window** (Alt+R)
3. **Click "Multi-buy" tab** (top of market window)
4. **Paste the list** into the multi-buy field
5. **Check the total cost** - should match `totalEstimatedCost` (Â±10%)
6. **Review individual prices** for outliers:
   - If an item is significantly more expensive than `estimatedCostPerUnit`, skip it
   - Look for items where `priceWasAdjusted: true` - these had inflated prices corrected
7. **Buy the items**
8. **Transport to destination hub**

#### Step 3: Price Validation

Before clicking "Buy All":

- **Total should be**: ~456,000,000 ISK (in this example)
- **If total is much higher**: Look for individual items that are overpriced
- **Safe rule**: If any single item costs >50% more than `estimatedCostPerUnit`, skip it

#### Step 4: Profit Tracking

- **Expected profit**: 89,000,000 ISK (in this example)
- **Transport cost**: Already included in calculations
- **Margin**: ~19.5% in this example

## Separate Shipments by Hub

The API automatically creates separate shopping lists for each destination hub:

### ðŸŽ¯ Amarr Shipment (50% allocation)

- Highest volume, best margins
- 23 items, 456M ISK cost, 89M profit

### ðŸš€ Dodixie Shipment (30% allocation)

- Good secondary market
- 15 items, 287M ISK cost, 45M profit

### âš¡ Hek Shipment (10% allocation)

- Smaller market, focused opportunities
- 5 items, 98M ISK cost, 14M profit

### ðŸ”¥ Rens Shipment (10% allocation)

- Niche opportunities
- 4 items, 96M ISK cost, 8M profit

## Pro Tips for POC Usage

1. **Start with one shipment** - test the system with Amarr first
2. **Double-check high-value items** - anything >100M ISK per unit
3. **Watch for price adjustments** - items with `priceWasAdjusted: true` were corrected from inflated prices
4. **Use cargo optimization** - all shipments are designed for 60kmÂ³ capacity
5. **Track liquidity** - items are pre-filtered for 4+ days/week trading activity

This format makes it super easy to execute the trading plan in-game! ðŸŽ¯
