# EVE Trade Profit Tracker - Project Progress

## Project Overview

Building a NestJS application to import, store, and analyze EVE Online market data from Adam4EVE platform with proper reference data normalization.

## Current Status: üü¢ Planning Phase 5 - ESI Real-time Price Collection

### ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

1. **Project Setup**
   - [x] NestJS project initialized

### üîÑ Current Phase: Reference Data Foundation

#### üìä Data Analysis (Adam4EVE)

**Reference Data Available** (from `doc/` folder):

- `type_ids.csv` - Item types (`typeID;typeName;published`) - 2MB
- `region_ids.csv` - Regions (`regionID;regionName`) - 115 lines
- `npcStation_ids.csv` - NPC Stations (`stationID;solarSystemID;stationName`) - 5,156 lines
- `solarSystem_ids.csv` - Solar Systems (`solarSystemID;solarSystemName;regionID`) - 8,439 lines

**Market Data**: `marketOrderTrades_daily_2025-07-29.csv` (39,508 records)

```
location_id;region_id;type_id;is_buy_order;has_gone;scanDate;amount;high;low;avg;orderNum;iskValue
```

**Adam4EVE Reference Source**: [https://static.adam4eve.eu/IDs/](https://static.adam4eve.eu/IDs/)

- Reference data updated daily at 5AM
- Files available in both CSV and TXT formats

**Database Schema Design**:

```
Region (1) -> (N) SolarSystem (1) -> (N) Station
ItemType (1) -> (N) MarketOrderTrade (N) -> (1) Region
         (N) -> (1) Station (optional, for NPC stations)

### üìù Technical Notes

**Current Architecture**

- Using PostgreSQL for better performance with large datasets
- NestJS for scalable backend architecture with proper service organization
- Prisma for type-safe database operations with proper relationships
- Daily data provides much richer analysis opportunities than weekly
- Proper normalization prevents data duplication and enables complex queries

**Phase 5+ Additions**

- ESI integration for real-time data (67 req/sec public, 333+ req/sec with auth)
- Smart rate limiting with ESI header monitoring and backoff strategies
- Advanced caching strategies for high-frequency price updates
- TypeScript interfaces for comprehensive type safety across all data models
- Real-time market price collection from tracked trade hubs

### üêõ Issues & Considerations

**Current Challenges**

- Large dataset size (39k+ records per day, growing with real-time data)
- Need efficient querying strategies with proper indexing
- Storage optimization for historical data
- Data integrity across daily imports
- Player structures not in NPC station reference (locationId might not always map to Station)

**New Phase 5+ Challenges**

- ESI rate limiting (100 requests/second) vs data freshness requirements
- OAuth2 token management and refresh handling for multiple characters
- Real-time price data volume (potentially 10x current data size)
- Cross-region price synchronization and consistency
- Character API scope management and security considerations
- Market data accuracy during downtime or connectivity issues
