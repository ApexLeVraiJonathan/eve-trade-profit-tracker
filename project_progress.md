# EVE Trade Profit Tracker - Project Progress

## Project Overview

Building a NestJS application to import, store, and analyze EVE Online market data from Adam4EVE platform with proper reference data normalization.

## Current Status: 🟡 In Progress - Reference Data Foundation

### ✅ Completed Tasks

1. **Project Setup**
   - [x] NestJS project initialized
   - [x] Prisma ORM configured with PostgreSQL
   - [x] Basic project structure in place
   - [x] Dependencies installed (NestJS, Prisma, TypeScript)

2. **Data Analysis & Schema Design**
   - [x] Analyzed Adam4EVE reference data structure
   - [x] Designed normalized Prisma schema with proper relationships
   - [x] Set up proper foreign key relationships

### 🔄 Current Phase: Reference Data Foundation

#### 📊 Data Analysis (Adam4EVE)

**Reference Data Available** (from `doc/` folder):

- `type_ids.csv` - Item types (`typeID;typeName;published`) - 2MB
- `region_ids.csv` - Regions (`regionID;regionName`) - 115 lines
- `npcStation_ids.csv` - NPC Stations (`stationID;solarSystemID;stationName`) - 5,156 lines
- `solarSystem_ids.csv` - Solar Systems (`solarSystemID;solarSystemName;regionID`) - 8,439 lines

**Market Data**: `marketOrderTrades_daily_2025-07-29.csv` (39,508 records)

```
location_id;region_id;type_id;is_buy_order;has_gone;scanDate;amount;high;low;avg;orderNum;iskValue
```

**Adam4EVE Reference Source**: [https://static.adam4eve.eu/IDs/](https://static.adam4eve.eu/IDs/)

- Reference data updated daily at 5AM
- Files available in both CSV and TXT formats

**Database Schema Design**:

```
Region (1) -> (N) SolarSystem (1) -> (N) Station
ItemType (1) -> (N) MarketOrderTrade (N) -> (1) Region
         (N) -> (1) Station (optional, for NPC stations)
```

### 🎯 Next Steps (Priority Order)

#### Phase 1: Reference Data Foundation ✅ COMPLETED

- [x] Design Prisma schema for reference data (regions, solar systems, stations, item types)
- [x] Run Prisma migration for reference tables
- [x] Create NestJS service to import reference data from CSV
- [x] Import initial reference data from `doc/` folder
  - **113 regions** imported (98% success rate)
  - **8,437 solar systems** imported (99.9% success rate)
  - **5,154 NPC stations** imported (99.9% success rate)
  - **50,243 item types** imported (much larger than expected!)
- [x] Create Adam4EVE fetcher service for fresh reference data from https://static.adam4eve.eu/IDs/
  - **✅ Availability checker**: Validates all files are accessible before download
  - **✅ Smart downloader**: Downloads all 4 reference files to temp directory
  - **✅ Auto-import**: Uses existing import service with fresh data
  - **✅ Cleanup**: Removes temp files after import
  - **✅ Diff tracking**: Shows exactly what changed (new regions, items, etc.)

#### Phase 2: Market Data Schema ✅ COMPLETED

- [x] Finalize market data schema with proper foreign keys
- [x] Run migration for market order trade table
- [x] Test referential integrity
- [x] Create TrackedStation model for selective monitoring
- [x] Create market data import service with filtering
- [x] Initialize default tracked stations (4 major trade hubs)
- [x] Successfully import sample data (11,248 records for tracked stations only)
- [x] Create comprehensive DTOs and interfaces with proper TypeScript typing
- [x] Build API endpoints for tracked station and market data management

#### Phase 3: Data Access Layer ✅ COMPLETED

- [x] Create market data service with proper joins
- [x] Implement common queries (by region, item type, date ranges)
- [x] Add data aggregation functions
- [x] Create REST API endpoints
- [x] CSV parser for Adam4EVE market data format (✅ working perfectly)
- [x] Data validation and deduplication (✅ upsert strategy implemented)
- [x] Import service for daily market data (✅ with smart filtering)
- [x] Error handling and logging (✅ comprehensive error tracking)

#### Phase 4: Automated Daily Data Pipeline ✅ COMPLETED

- [x] **Smart Daily Data Fetcher** - Automatically identifies and downloads missing files
- [x] **Gap Detection** - Compares DB vs available files to find missing dates
- [x] **Intelligent Processing** - Only downloads what's needed (max 16 days back)
- [x] **Robust Error Handling** - Handles missing files, network issues, and partial failures
- [x] **Dev/Prod Ready** - Works whether system was down or running continuously
- [x] **Real-time Status** - Monitor how up-to-date your data is
- [x] **File Availability Check** - See what's available on Adam4EVE before fetching
- [x] **🤖 Internal Cron Scheduler** - Built-in scheduling runs daily at 6 AM UTC
- [x] **Environment Control** - Enable/disable scheduling with ENABLE_SCHEDULER env var
- [x] **Manual Triggers** - Force immediate fetch via API for testing/emergency
- [x] **Scheduler Management** - Enable/disable, status monitoring, and detailed logging

#### Phase 5: Future Enhancements

- [x] **Internal Scheduling** - Built-in cron job runs daily at 6 AM UTC ✅
- [ ] Add monitoring and alerts for import failures (email notifications)
- [ ] Price trend analysis and profit calculations
- [ ] Data visualization and reporting
- [ ] Performance optimization for large datasets
- [ ] Market volatility alerts and notifications
- [ ] Integration with EVE Online ESI API for real-time data validation

### 🔮 Future Phases

- Market trend analysis with proper location/item context
- Data visualization with geographical and item-type filtering
- Performance optimization for large historical datasets
- Additional data sources integration

### 📝 Technical Notes

- Using PostgreSQL for better performance with large datasets
- NestJS for scalable backend architecture with proper service organization
- Prisma for type-safe database operations with proper relationships
- Daily data provides much richer analysis opportunities than weekly
- Proper normalization prevents data duplication and enables complex queries

### 🐛 Issues & Considerations

- Large dataset size (39k+ records per day)
- Need efficient querying strategies with proper indexing
- Storage optimization for historical data
- Data integrity across daily imports
- Player structures not in NPC station reference (locationId might not always map to Station)
